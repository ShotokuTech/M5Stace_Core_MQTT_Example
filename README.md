# M5Stace_Core_MQTT_Example
We use a pair of M5Stack Basic Core IoT units to publish and subscribe to dualing topics.

In my previous video we installed Raspberry Pi OS Lite on the new Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W headlessly, no keyboard or monitor. Now, I want to build my own Mosquito MQTT broker. This Cedalo Platform installs Mosquito, an MQTT Web Management Interface and something called Streamsheets. It is so simple to just copy and paste one line of code into an SSH session in PowerShell to install Docker and this Cedalo Platform container. Watch step by step installation. Configure clients in the management center. Then we program a pair of M5Stack Basic Core IoT units to publish and subscribe to dualing topics using UIFlow (flow.m5stack.com). The Core units then turn each other's RGB LED bars red or green based on a button pressed on each of the Core units.
